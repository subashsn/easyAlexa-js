# EasyAlexa-JS

**EasyAlexa-JS** is an abstraction framework that essentially eliminates the need for dealing with the `alexa-app` server implementations and lets you build your application logic as a simple HTTP Server.

**alexa-front** is the `alexa-app` implementation, that communicates with Amazon's servers.

**alexa-back** is the backend application logic that can be written in any language because it only needs to be a HTTP Server.

More documentation will follow.
